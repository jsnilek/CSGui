Centuries ago, in the time we now call the Dark Ages, whole regions of the world were undiscovered. There were pockets of civilization, each with their own races and cultures. One such region was Kakha-bad, a dark land at the end of the earth.\n\nAlthough several warlords had tried, Kakhabad had never beenruled. All manner of evil creatures, forced from the more civilizedlands beyond the Zanzunu Peaks, had gradually crawled into Kakha-bad, which became known as the Verminpit at Earth End.\n\nCivilization and order had spread throughout the rest of the knownworld ever since the discovery of the Crown of Kings by Chalanna theReformer, of Femphrey. With its help, Chalanna became Emperor ofthe largest empire in the eastern world. This magical Crown hadmysterious powers, bestowing supernormal qualities of leadershipand justice on its owner. But Chalanna's own ambitions were not ofconquest. He wished instead to establish peaceful nation-states, aligned to Femphrey. Thus in his wisdom he passed the fabled Crownfrom ruler to ruler in the neighbouring kingdoms, and, with the helpof its magical powers, one by one these lands became peaceful and prosperous.\n\nThe path was set. Each ruler would own the Crown of Kings for afour-year period in which to establish order within his kingdom andfall in with the growing Femphrey Alliance. So far the kingdoms ofRuddles tone, Lendleland, Gallantaria and Brice had taken their turnsunder the rule of the Crown. The benefits were immediate. War and strife were virtually unknown.\n\nThe King of Analand duly received the Crown of Kings amid greatceremony, and from that day onwards, the development of Analandwas ensured. No one quite knew how the Crown of Kings could have such an enormous uplifting effect on a whole nation. Some said it was divinely inspired some that its power was merely in the mind. Butone thing was certain its effects were unquestionable. All was wellin Analand, until the night of the Black Moon.\n\nThe King was the first to discover that the Crown was missing.Carried off on that starless night by Birdmen from Xamen, theCrown was on its way to Mampang in the outlaw territories of Kakhabad. News came from the Baklands that the Crown was beingcarried to the Archmage of Mampang whose ambitions were to make Kakhabad his kingdom.\n\nAlthough Kakhabad was a dangerous land, it was in itself little threatto the surrounding kingdoms. The lack of rule meant it had no armyand its own internal struggles kept it permanently preoccupied. But with the Crown of Kings to establish rule, Kakhabad could potentiallybe a deadly enemy to all members of the Femphrey Alliance.\n\nSuch was the shame that fell on Analand for the loss of the Crown thatall benefits from two years under its rule soon disappeared. Law,order and morale were breaking down. The King was losing theconfidence of his subjects. Neighbouring territories were looking suspiciously across their borders. There were even whisperings of invasions.\n\nOne hope remained. Someone - for a military force would neversurvive the journey - must travel to Mampang and rescue the Crownof Kings. Only on its safe return would the dreadful curse be lifted from Analand. You have volunteered yourself for this quest and yourmission is clear. You must cross Kakhabad to the Mampang Fortressand find the Crown!;1
You awake at sunrise. After dressing, you breakfast on bread and goat's milk and collect your belongings. Outside, the Outpost Settle-ment is stirring: the women folk emerge to wash and prepare their rmeals as the day's guard takes over.\n\nEyes follow you as you leave your hut and walk towards the Shamu-tanti Wall. The frontiers people are well aware of your mission and asmall crowd of well-wishers follows some distance behind you.\n\nBefore you stands the Cantopani Gate. Guarded constantly by Sight-master Warriors, chosen for their powers of telescopic vision, the Gate is the final doorway between Analand and Kakhabad. Oncemore you check your pack.\n\nSatisfied that your preparations are complete, you nod to the Sight-master Sergeant. For the last time he glances at the look-out atop thegate, who signals the all-clear. The Sergeant orders the bolt to bewithdrawn. A doorway opens up in front of you and you get your firstview of the Shamutanti foothills, the first stage of your journey.\n\nThe Sight master Sergeant strides over and grasps your hand. 1 willnot wish you a safe journey, for the way ahead will not be safe.Kakhabad is a treacherous land inhabited by devils. But this youalready know,\n\nTake the path ahead to Cantopani, a small settlement of traders -although most are rogues and thieves which you should reachwithin the hour. From Cantopani onwards there are three routesthrough Birritanti to Khare, acityporton the Jabaji river. From Khareyou must cross the Baklands, which are unknown, it is said that dayand night in the Bakiands are controlled not by the sun but bysupernatural forces and bear in mind also that, from Khare onwards, your progress will be watched\n\nHis warnings do little to inspire confidence in you. He continues: ButI have observed your training and you are indeed a worthy champion.I wish you luck and success with your quest. My thoughts, and thegood wishes of all the peoples of Analand, will be with you. With Libra on your side may you live lo lift the curse and depression which crack our kingdom\n\nYou shake his hand, thank him for his good w ishes and step up to theGate. Resolutely, you pass through the doorway. The faces of the folkwatching your departure reveal the hopes that rest with you and withthe success of your quest.\n\nWith a wave, you turn and face the hills. The early morning air is crispand the rising sun paints the hills in colours of natural beauty whichconceal the devilry ahead.Setting off determinedly, you follow the path. Your quest has begun!
